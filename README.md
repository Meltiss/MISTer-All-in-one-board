# MISTer-All-in-one-board

This project has been made in the case of a school project.
It has been my teacher that after I ask him if I can make a project about FPGA's and retrogaming proposed me to work on the MISTer.

The goal of my project is to make a single PCB for all the expansions like the RAM or the RTC. Then I made a case that looks like a 80-90's computer to fit all in it.
